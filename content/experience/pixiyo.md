- Handling projects from intake to production, then delivery - making sure they were shipped right on time. And that our clients had a smile on their face &#128578;
- Designing, coding, and maintaining websites
- Creating brand identities, defining their guidelines (logos, colours, fonts, etc.)
- Visual assets for various brands, the usual stuff. Social media banners, icons, etc.

Our biggest project was for [Valdys Group](https://www.thalasso.com/thalasso-valdysr/valdys-groupe/), who offers all-inclusive spa, restaurants and hotels resorts.   
That is: the merging and redesign of 8 hotel landing pages into one website, allowing users to search and book a stay.   
For that:  

- I helped planning and managing the project, smoothing the communication between teams
- Designed and shipped this big-arse classy website
