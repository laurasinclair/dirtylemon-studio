# image-compress

A little npm package to compress and optimize image files in a directory and sub directories for the command line.

## Usage

In your terminal, cd into the directory/project with images you wish to compress then run ```npx @adamholtzman/image-compress```

This will create a new directory named `compressed` with all of the compressed images in the same directory format as the source.


Alternatively you can globally install with ```npm i -g @adamholtzman/image-compress``` if you prefer not to use ```npx```
